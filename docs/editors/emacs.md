## Emacs

I use Emacs because it is what I started using in graduate school. One
advantage of doing everything in Emacs is that I can integrate several
different software environments that are generally useful for climate
research. For example, with [python-mode]{.roman} I can start a python
shell from a python script and send commands to that shell. At the same
time I might be working on scripts in Matlab, NCL, and shell -- as well
as latex files like this one. All of these have their own modes in
Emacs, which makes editing files for each of these programs vastly less
complicated than it otherwise would be.

-   ### Tmux
    Tmux is installed on most of our systems. It is a powerful tool because
    it lets you keep a terminal running on a remote sever even when you have
    logged out. This is especially useful if you are a user of Matlab(R),
    which you should not be if you can avoid it.

-   ### AucTex
    Once you have Emacs, you can install AucTex. The easiest way to do this
    is by installing using the [M-x]{.roman} then [package-install]{.roman}.

-   ### flyspell-mode
    If you are writing in LaTeX, it is good to have a tool like flyspell
    (which uses aspell) so that words that are misspelled can easily be
    corrected with keystrokes: <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell>.
