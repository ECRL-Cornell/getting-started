## **BASH  Documentation Online**
### Most online Bash documentation is written by people who had a hand in writing the man pages, so the docs are often terse and take some getting used to.

-   [a readable bash manual](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html)
    For those who don't already know how it works, try this documentation
    from Case Western University & the Free Software Foundation.
    It is easier to read than most other Bash resources and is
    downloadable as a PDF (172 pages) that includes a detailed index.

-   [official bash reference](https://www.gnu.ord/s/bash/manual/bash.pdf)
    Written in "geek speak", this one is for those who already know
    how things work but need to refresh their memory.

-   ["Cheat sheet"](https://devhints.io/bash)
    A pretty good online cheat sheet once you know your way around

-   [command line reference for Linux](https://ss64.com/bash)
    An alphabetical reference page for Linux OS shell commands

-   [command line reference for Mac OS X](https://ss64.com/osc)
    An alphabetical reference page for Mac OS X shell commands

-   [official bash reference](https://www.gnu.ord/s/bash/manual/bash.pdf)
    Most complete documentation, but written in _"geek speak"_. Most useful for those who already have an understanding of how it works.

-------
## **There are also man (manual) pages for all Bash commands**

These are typically terse, so they are more usefull after you
get comfortable with using the command

-   For example, the **_ls_** command lists all items in a directory. However
    **_ls_** also has 38 options for restricting and formatting it's output. To view all of these options type : **_man ls__**

-   _```WARNING DO NOT TRY``` **man bash**_, it will produce a seemingly endles
    stream of information about every single bash command and utility.
