# Introduction to the Linux/Mac OS command line

### ECRL tools are developed and run locally on Linux servers and Mac OS computers. All of these computers are based on a version of Linux that uses the **_Bourne Again Shell_** (Bash) for developing project code and controlling software execution. Whenver you work in a terminal or run a script you are using the Bash shell. So a basic knowledge of Bash commands and scripting tools is essential.

-------
### On ECRL's Linux servers, you get a terminal as soon as you login. However, on Mac OS desktops you should have a square black icon with a white &nbsp;```>_ ```&nbsp; on the application Dock when you login. That is a link to the Terminal app. If it is missing, you have to go to the **```/Applications/Utilities```** and and find the **```Terminal.app```**. You can either douple click on it to launch a terminal immediately or you can drag it's icon to the Dock to make it easeier to find next time.

### By default, the terminal command line prompt on machines managed by Cornell IT shows the machine name followed by the user's NetID and 2 right arrows :

>  **AG-EAS-12345678: mynetid >>**
