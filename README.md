# Emergent Climate Risks Lab @ Cornell University
## _Software Development_

### Practical guildelines for software development including introductory documentation for important tools such as bash, text editors, Python and the Anaconda package manager for users of Linux or Mac OS operating systems.

&nbsp;

## _Bash command line and shell_

-------

### Efficient use and development of software for Atmospheric Science requires a basic knowledge of [GNU Bash commands and scripting tools](docs/bash/readme.md)  for developing project code and controlling software execution.

&nbsp;

-------
## _Programming_

### Python has become the primary programming language used to develop Atmospheric Science applications. Our [**_Dive into Python_**](docs/python.md) will help you get started with (or get better at) writing efficient Python software. Of course, common coding guidelines and best practices for shared code are in there too.

### ECRL uses the open source [**_Anaconda Package Manager_**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to simplify creation and managemnt of Python environments. The "wrapper scripts" in [**_Anaconda tools_**](myanaconda/personaluse.md) will make it easier for individual developers to manage those environments on their personal computers.

### Pick your editor and learn it well with the help of [**_these handy guides_**](docs/editors/READ.me).

### With multiple people working together on most projects, a managed source code reository is critical. All of ECRL's source code repositries use the GIT version control system. [**_Using Git_**](./docs/git.md) will get you started and point you to more details.
